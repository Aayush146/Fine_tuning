    "# FINE TUNING \n",
    "As mentioned before, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is a process that allows models to adapt to specific tasks, domains, or user requirements. However, depending on the size of the model and the fine-tuning dataset, the process can take a significant amount of time and demand high-performance GPUs to handle the computation load. However, there are various ways one can make the task more computationally efficient. One method is called Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT), which helps fine tune only a small subset of a model’s parameters, significantly reducing the computational expenses while freezing the weights of original pretrained LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "One PEFT method is called LoRA, which stands for Low Rank Adaptation. This technique introduces trainable rank decomposition matrices (matrices A and B in the image below) within the transformer architecture and also reduces trainable parameters for downstream task while keeping the pre trained weights frozen. The method assumes that redundant information is often easily stored in a big matrix, especially in high-dimensional spaces. Hence, a more \"parameter efficient\" matrix can capture the important data attributes during training.\n",

    "So we should be able to go ahead and start fine tuning the model right? Unfortunately, there is another step we must consider before proceeding. In most fine tuning cases, you may be limited to a single GPU. Therefore, we need to be able to make the fine tuning method even more efficient. This is where Quantized Low Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "QLoRA is the extended version of LoRA which works by quantizing the precision of the weight parameters in the pre trained LLM to 4-bit precision. Typically, parameters of trained models are stored in a 32-bit format, but QLoRA compresses them to a 4-bit format. This reduces the memory footprint of the LLM, making it possible to finetune it on a single GPU."

    "## Model training arguements\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets define the training arguements for training our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **num_train_epochs:** This is the number of times the model will go through your entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **bf16/fp16:** floating point data format or binary float format to use during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **per_device_train_batch_size:** The number of samples that are processed before weights are updated Larger batch sizes generally lead to more stable training, although we would need to consider our GPU memory. We can use gradient accumulation to effectively take in larger batches over multiple forward/backward passes befoer updating the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **per_device_eval_batch_size:** The size of the batch used for evaluation, ususally should be the same as the training batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **gradient_accumulation_steps:** Instead of updating the A and B matrices/weights after each batch of data, you accumulate the gradients from batches before performing the weight update.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **max_grad_norm:** Limits the maximum magnitude of gradients during training to prevent exploding gradients. Common values are 1, 3, 5, 8, 10\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Learning_rate:** Controls the size of adjustments made to the A and B parameters (weights) at each iteration during optimization. A low number might cause training to be slow and may also cause the model to get stuck in local minima. Too high and the training may become unstable or diverge, which will degrade the performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. **weight_decay:** a value added to the computation of the loss function which restricts the development of large paramters.weights. Encourages the model to learn more simple and generalisable featreus. Usually a value of 0.01 works well.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **optim:** An optimizer is a crucial element that fine-tunes a neural network's parameters during training. Its primary role is to minimize the model's error or loss function , enhancing performance. In practice, Adamw8-bit is stringly recommended, it performs as well as its 32bit version while using less memory. There is a paged version (Parts of the optimizer states are moved automativally between CPU and GPU when you use this version).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **lr_scheduler_type:** changes the learning rate during learning. Starting with a higher LR for rapid initial progress and then decreasing it in later stages. Linear and cosine schedulers are the two most common options.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **warmup_steps:** the initial training period where the learning rate is set low to gradually adjust the newly added parameters (like LoRA matrices) before ramping up to a higher learning rate for full optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **group_by_length:** Group sequences into batches with same length. Saves memory and speeds up training considerably. \n",
    "\n",
    "13. **logging_steps:** Log every X updates steps\n"

      "Taenia solium is an intestinal parasite of humans that causes cysticercosis, a disease that can lead to serious health problems if not treated. The parasite is spread by the consumption of undercooked pork or other meat infected with Taenia solium cysts. The infection is found throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, the Far East, and parts of Africa and Asia. In the United States, the disease has been found in California, Florida, and Texas. The disease is also called cysticercosis, taeniasis, and taeniasis taenialis.\n",
      "What are the symptoms of Taenia solium infection?\n",
      "The symptoms of cysticercosis caused by Taenia solium infection are similar to those of other intestinal infections, such as gastroenteritis (inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestines), but can be confused with other conditions. The disease is usually more severe in children and adults with weak immune systems. The symptoms of cysticercosis caused by Taenia solium infection include\n",

      "Treatment for Taenia solium infection is the same as for Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm infection). The infection is usually treated with albendazole or mebendazole. In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove cysts that are causing complications. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that health care providers use albendazole for treatment of Taenia solium\n"
